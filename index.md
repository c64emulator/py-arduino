## Welcome to py-arduino

**py-arduino** is a **Python** library to communicate with **Arduinos**.

It consist of two layers:

 - a **low level tool/library**, very easy to use and **extend**,
 - a **web application**, including a **web interface** and **background threads**, based on Django, uWSGI, Pyro: it's multithread, allow concurrent access, labeling of pins to facilitate the use, etc..

The project has many **testing** utilities, a simple **emulator** and the ability to see DEBUG messages to facilitate the location of problems and subsequent solutions.
