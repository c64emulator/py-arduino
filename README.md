Py-Arduino-Proxy
================

![Architecture overview](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/architecture-overview.png "Architecture overview")

**Py-Arduino-Proxy** is a **Python** library to communicate with **Arduinos**. [Versi칩n en espa침ol.](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/blob/master/README-es.md "Versi칩n en espa침ol")

It's a **low level tool**, very easy to **extend** (it is very easy to create a new method in ArduinoProxy class and attach this method to a Arduino function).
The project has many **testing** utilities and the ability to see DEBUG messages, to facilitate the location of problems and subsequent solutions.

A **web interface** is in progress. See the [Web-Interface wiki page](https://github.com/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/wiki/Web-Interface) for instructions and screenshots.

*Unresolved issues: currently, there are problems when working with interrupts, since characters may be lost if an interrupt occurs while 
reading the serial with Serial.read(). This is an inherent problem of serial communication of Arduino, but may be fixed in next versions of Py-Arduino-Proxy
if a work-around is found.*

Installation
------------

See the [install instructions on the wiki](https://github.com/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/wiki/How-to-install "Install instructions")
and the **Videos** section at the bottom of the page.


How it works 
------------

First connect to the Arduino. 

![Connect](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-connect.png "Connect")

Once connected, we can execute the methods on the instance of ArduinoProxy. For example, to read a digital pin: 

![Digital Read](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-digital-read.png "Digital Read")

To set output HIGH on a digital pin: 

![Digital Write](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-digital-write.png "Digital Write")

Implemented methods  
------------------- 

The basic methods of Arduino are implemented. The following actions can be done from Python: 

* Check communication with Arduino (ping) 
* pinMode()
* digitalRead()
* digitalWrite()
* analogRead()
* analogWrite()
* Get the value returned by millis() and micro()
* Run delay() and delayMicroseconds()
* watchInterrupt() and getInterruptMark() to work with interrupts
* shiftOut()
* Show messages on LCDs, based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset.
