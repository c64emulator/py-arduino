Py-Arduino-Proxy
================

Python application to communicate with Arduinos. [Versi칩n en espa침ol.](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/blob/master/README-es.md "Versi칩n en espa침ol")

How it works 
------------- 

First connect to the Arduino. 

![Connect](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-connect.png "Connect")

Once connected, we can execute the methods on the instance of ArduinoProxy. For example, to read a digital pin: 

![Digital Read](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-digital-read.png "Digital Read")

To set output HIGH on a digital pin: 

![Digital Write](/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy/raw/master/examples/arduino-proxy-digital-write.png "Digital Write")

Pros and cons 
-------------- 

* PRO: very easy to extend: it is very easy to create a new method in ArduinoProxy class (Python) and attach this method to a Arduino function. 

* PRO: testing utilities and the ability to see DEBUG messages facilitate the location of problems and subsequent solutions.

* CONS: currently has problems working with interruptions, since characters may be lost if an interruption occurs while 
reading the serial with Serial.read(). This can be fixed in next versions of Py-Arduino-Proxy. 

Implemented methods  
------------------- 

The basic methods of Arduino are implemented. The following actions can be done from Python: 

* Check communication with Arduino (ping) 
* pinMode()
* digitalRead()
* digitalWrite()
* analogRead()
* analogWrite()
* Get the value returned by millis() and micro()
* Run delay() and delayMicroseconds()
* watchInterrupt() and getInterruptMark() to work with interrupts
* shiftOut()
* Show messages on LCDs, based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset.

Installation
============

Step 1: Download the project code using Git
-------------------------------------------

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git://github.com/hgdeoro/py-arduino-proxy.git

Step 2: Compile and upload the Arduino sketch
---------------------------------------------

The sketch will be located in ~/py-arduino-proxy/pde/py_arduino_proxy/py_arduino_proxy.pde

You only need to open it with the Arduino IDE, compile and upload. 

First tests
-----------

To verify that all steps were completed successfully, you can use the ping.py script. It will execute
indefinitely until you press Ctrl+C:

	$ ~/py-arduino-proxy/bin/ping.py /dev/ttyACM0 
	Ping sent... OK - Time=19.834 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=18.816 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=18.772 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=18.940 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=28.531 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=19.002 ms
	Ping sent... OK - Time=18.784 ms
	^C
